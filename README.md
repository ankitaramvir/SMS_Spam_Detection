# SMS Spam Detection Project

## Problem Statement
Scammers send fake text messages to trick you into giving them your personal information â€” things like your password, account number, or Social Security number. If they get that information, they could gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts.
Therefore this project is created to detect which SMS is ham or spam.
